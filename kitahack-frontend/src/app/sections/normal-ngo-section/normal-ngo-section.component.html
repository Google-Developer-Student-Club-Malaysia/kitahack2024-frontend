      The Normal Track is an opportunity for you to work on a solution that addresses one or more
      of the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These goals aim to end poverty, ensure
      prosperity, and protect the planet.

      <strong class="text-black font-[GoogleSans-Bold]">You will have the freedom to choose a theme within the 17 SDGs
        and develop a solution that makes a positive impact on that theme.

    <p class="mt-5 text-left text-gray-700">The NGO Track is an opportunity for you to work on a specific problem statement provided by
      our collaborating non-governmental organizations (NGOs). These problem statements address real-world
      challenges that the NGOs are currently facing, and
      <strong class="text-black font-[GoogleSans-Bold]">
        your goal is to come up with a solution that addresses these challenges.
      </strong> You will have the opportunity to attend a sharing session with the
      NGOs, where they will describe their stories, challenges, and solutions they have tried. There will also be
      mentoring sessions available for teams who would like to consult further with the NGOs.

        <p class="pt-5 text-lg"><strong class="text-black">Problem Statement: How can we make it easier for teachers to track student
            attendance in rural areas?</strong></p>
        <p class="pt-1.5 text-gray-700">The very first step of learning is being there to learn. TFM has found difficulties in
          keeping track of student's attendance and subsequently, a lack of data to enhance their teaching. Many
          teachers use pencil and paper as it is the most convenient.</p>
        <p class="pt-1.5 text-gray-700">Teachers in TFM come from far and wide. Any solution created needs to be low-bandwidth
          proof or offline. Often, TFM loses touch with teachers for close to a month in rural areas.</p>
        <p class="pt-1.5 text-gray-700">Most of the students are primary schoolchildren from government schools. Your effort would
          not only help TFM, but many other organizations pushing for quality education in Malaysia.</p>

        <p class="pt-5 text-lg"><strong class="text-black">Problem Statement: How do we upskill and empower refugee women to find
            sustainable forms of income?</strong></p>
        <p class="pt-1.5 text-gray-700">There are an estimated 182,990 refugees in Malaysia. Due to the lack of recognition for
          refugees, access to employment is extremely difficult and abuse is common. Women are on the brunt of
          this displacement.</p>
        <p class="pt-1.5 text-gray-700">WFR currently has the Refugee Women Development Programme (RWDP) for language & financial
          literacy and skill-based training such as sewing and crochet. However, it is difficult to convince women
          to commit cause they do not see the long term benefit of upskilling.</p>
        <p class="pt-1.5 text-gray-700">Furthermore, there is a lack of resources like materials and teachers to conduct
          upskilling programs. Lastly, WFT is always looking for ways to market and sell products made by refugee
          women to outside parties.</p>
